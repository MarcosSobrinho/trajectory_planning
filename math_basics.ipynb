    "# Trajectory planning of self driving cars with a continuous method\n",
    "I implement a simple version of the trajectory planning method described in [Trajectory Planning for BERTHA - a Local, Continuous Method](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bdca/7fe83f8444bb4e75402a417053519758d36b.pdf). To make things easier, I only focus on the longitudinal control. This means that I only plan the velocity decomposition of the car. The mathematical basics behind the method are described below. \n",
